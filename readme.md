# File Watcher project
This is a simple Spring Boot project demonstrating how to use a file watcher in Java. When a file is created within the watched directory, it triggers an event, allowing for further processing of the file. In Enterprise Integration Patterns, Gregor Hohpe mentions file systems as one of the integration options. This project aims to guide Spring Boot developers on utilizing the file system as an integration option. Other integration options include:

- Messaging
- Shared Database
- Remote Procedure Calls
